# Laser TAG/OS

**Open Source Laser Tag**

This project is in it's infancy, with loads still to do. The 3D model is based primarily on the Design of Skirmos, a failed kickstarter that was also promised as open-source...

The overarching concept is to create a 3D printable laser tag game, with simple electronics that can be assembled by anyone, using readily available parts and components. 

## Key Features

- 3D printable tagger and receivers
- Tagger includes TFT screen, rail for mounting scopes
- On-board sound effects
- Toggle switch for different fire modes
- Custom PCB simplifies the electronics



## What you'll need

A full list of materials should be availble on the BOM page. You'll also need a 3D printer (I use an Ender 3) and various tools like a soldering iron etc.
